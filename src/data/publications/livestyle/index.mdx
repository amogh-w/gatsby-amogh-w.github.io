# Abstract

Art is a variety of human activities that include the production of visual, auditory, or performing objects that express the creativity, creative concepts, or technological abilities of the artist, intended primarily for their beauty or emotional power to be appreciated. The renaissance of historic and forgotten art has been made possible by modern developments in Artificial Intelligence. Techniques for Computer Vision have long been related to such arts. Style Transfer using Neural Networks refers to optimization techniques, where a content image and a style image are taken and blended such that it feels like the content image is reconstructed in the style image color palette. This paper implements the Style Transfer using three different Neural Networks in form of an application that is accessible to the general population thereby reviving interest in lost art styles.
