## Important:

Picking an image from the gallery is limited by the tfjs fetch request - [Read More](https://github.com/amandeepmittal/mobilenet-tfjs-expo/issues/1)

## Available Scripts:

In the project directory, you can run: `yarn android`

The App will open on Simulator or device connected with adb.

Generate a keystore with this [guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android) in the android\app directory, and run:

`./gradlew clean` and then `./gradlew assembleRelease` to generate apk.
