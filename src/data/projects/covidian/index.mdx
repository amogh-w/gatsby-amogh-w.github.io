### An COVID Tweet Sentiment Visualizer and Analyser Application

## About The Project:

COVIDian offers different ways of visualizing as well as analyzing tweets.

- COVIDian is now available in dark mode!
- National-level statistics are available on the main dashboard.
  - Cumulative data on emotions are displayed in the doughnut chart, and city hotspots are displayed in the radar chart.
  - To remove a city/emotion from the chart, _simply click on it_!
  - Over 6000 tweets (and counting) and their emotion values are displayed on the main dashboard.
- **Map of India** visualizes the emotion distribution, emotion wise! Just change the emotion to view the distribution.
- Users can view state-wise information as well! Click on the state and see the results. Map of state, radar chart for emotions and, state-specific tweets will be shown. _District/City-wise distribution is in beta phase and will be out soon_
- **Tweet Analyzer** is where the real magic is at, all you have to do is put a tweet and our model will predict its emotions! To make our lives easy we have embedded twitter as well, just type the twitter handle and we fetch the tweet for you.
- To keep in touch with reality and severity of COVID-19, **Resources** tab offers you _COVID-19 tracker_. Daily updates on infected, recovered and deaths related to coronavirus can be seen here.
- **COVIDianBot** will use AI technology to understand what you are typing and will reply with the correct answer to your query.You can ask the bot the number of cases or the results of sentiment analysis.
